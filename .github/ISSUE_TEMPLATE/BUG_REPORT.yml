      description: |
        A minimal reproduction is necessary so others can understand and debug your bug.

        Provide a link to a minimal reproduction repository:
        - Set the command to run in the `package.json` script `start`
        - For a starter template, [fork this template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-guv65j?file=webpack.config.js&view=editor)
        - No more than 10 files. Delete irrelevant files (e.g. `LICENSE`, `.npmrc`, `.github`). This is the first step of debugging so doing this will save us work.
          üëâ **Tip:** The _smaller_ the reproduction, the _faster_ we can debug and resolve your issue

        ‚ö†Ô∏è If a _minimal_ reproduction is not provided, the issue will be closed
      placeholder: üëÜ Your issue will be CLOSED if it doesn't follow the instructions above.
